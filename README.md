# my-calculator
My calculator I forked from https://github.com/hebrews110/calculator and made it my own.

You can visit my calulator at https://qsl.net/k0nnk/index1.html

Yeah, yeah, I used index1.html but will soon host it on my http://k0nnk.us.to/ server I was a lot younger when I did that.

If you want to modify this or put it somewhere please put 'Written by Collin K0NNK he forked from github.com/hebrews110'

Thanks and this is always OPEN SOURCE AND 100% FREE TO USE :)
